# Java Syntax

- every Java program has a class name that must match the file name

```java
public static void main(String[] arg) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

We need a main method for every Java program.

- Curly braces surround the code to be executed.
- Each code statement ends with a semicolon.
- You can use System.out.println("String to be outputted.") to output a string to the console.
- The string must be wrapped in double quotation marks.
- You can make single line comments with // to start the comment
- Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
